AllTray: Copyright 2004, 2005, Jochen Baier, email@jochen-baier.de

  With AllTray you can dock any application with no native tray icon
  (like Evolution, Thunderbird, Terminals) into the system tray.
  A high-light feature is that a click on the "close" button
  will minimize back to system tray. It works well with Gnome,
  KDE, XFCE 4*, Fluxbox* and WindowMaker*.
  
  *no drag 'n drop support


**Install:

  (./autogen.sh)
  ./configure
  make

  and as root:

  make install


**Run:

  just start alltray with:

    alltray program_name
      
  This will dock the program into the system tray. A single click
  with the left mouse button on the icon will show the program.
  A click with the right mouse button will show a popdown menu.
  
  For the "Click-Mode" start alltray with:
  
    alltray
    
  and click on the target window.
  


  A click on the "close" button ("X") in the window title will not exit the
  application. The application will be minimized.
  
  To quit the application use the popdown menu or the "FILE->QUIT" menu
  from the application.
  
  The "Undock" menu item will undock the window. Yeahh really ;)
  
  If you use the "--borderless" option, you can move the window with
  "Alt-left_mouse_button".

  
  Note: * Under KDE the "large_icon" option has no effect.
           * "--configure" option will only work under KDE. You need to configure 
              AllTray after each theme change.


**All options:

  alltray -h:
  
  usage: alltray [options] ["] <program_name> [program parameter] ["]
