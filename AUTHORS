=======

AllTray was originally written by Jochen Baier and was released under
the GPL v2 (or later) license.  The original AllTray icon was created by
Eugene Alex <Frame3@narod.ru>, and the original AllTray man page was
created by Carlos C. Soto <csoto@sia-solutions.com>.

None of the original components exists as it used to; in particular, a
new icon was created and the man page was completely rewritten.  The
AllTray source code is (currently) being re-written as well to bring it
up-to-date and make it consistent with itself.
